What better way to test out a classifier than to have a simple working UI to take it for a spin? 

The classifier has two classes (Horses and Humans, duhh) Simply upload an image and check whether your image is a Horse or Human

With 93% accuracy the classifier sometimes could be wrong but whom to blame if your friend looks so horse-like?
